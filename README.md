# FileOrganizer
A simple Python script that organizes downloads and desktop folders. Currently sorts media into Photos/Video and Documents. 
Works in conjunction with fswatch and a zsh script executed by Automator, invoking the script everytime a change is detected in the aforementioned directories.
